# ChessMate
A beginner-friendly chess website that helps people learning how to play **Chess**.
More than just playing **Chess**, the developing features are worth waiting for such as `shop, blogs, FAQS,...` so stay tuned!
Login forms are expected to be done soon, using `Firebase`, a NOSQL database (perhaps?).
